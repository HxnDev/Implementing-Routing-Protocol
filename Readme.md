# How to run:

###### 1: Compile s1, s2, s4, c and proxy.cpp.
###### 2: In separate terminals, run the executables of all server files in this order s1 -> s2 -> s4 -> proxy.
###### 3: Again in separate terminals, run the client executable. For multiple clients, run the same executable in different terminals.
###### 4: Select whatever you wish the clients to do.
